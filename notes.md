# Ludum Dare 49 - Theme: Unstable - Notes

General:
- Top-down 2D actiony Zelda-type game again?

Ideas:
- insanity? meter that gradually goes up, and bad stuff happens, once it becomes full?
	- like losing hitpoints, weird screen effects, slowdown, enemy "fakes" duplicating, that don't do damage, but confuse, worsened vision etc.
- movement is "unstable" in some way? balancing over a bridge, winds pushing the character etc?
	- limited space, limiting players movement into almost just 2 directions? like a tight rope basically?
- unstable ground, which can break, and make player fall down deeper?
	- but then its like a tower/mine, which has endless (?) levels down, that get harder though
	- the challenge is to not fall down, before you managed to get the resources/power ups from the current level, which make you stronger slowly
- player does not get to decide when to attack, but it happens automatically on a random timer every X seconds, like a bomb, chemicals, fire breathing or whatever, you are cursed maybe?
- alchemy tower? Open up with a potion in the middle of the room "Drink the option!", And then you start breathing fire periodically + tower/ground starts shaking, because alchemist got mad or something idk :P
	- all the power ups are potions too, give you more health, higher movement speed, maybe more DMG, change fire shape maybe
	
	

ToDos:
- Type of attack/effect randomizes:
	- Have a little indicator/icon for everything, which also shows where you are aiming!
	
	Types
	- Fire projectile
	- Breath fire cone
	- Dash forward
	- Heal what is under your mouse cursor?
	- etc.

- UI for Health, Attackpower, Movementspeed , just simple icon for everything + number?
- Add different enemy types
  - Ranged attackers
  - Stronger/charging Melee
  - Bosses
  - Add melee swipes, instead of them just running into you?

- Give characters collision boxes, so they dont overlap/stack anymore?

- instead of potions just use a staff at the beginning, and some kind of random gemstones/pickups for the power ups
	- might be easier to find than nice potions, and makes more sense, why picking up a sacred staff might make the building fall, than a random potion?
