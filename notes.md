# Ludum Dare 49 - Theme: Unstable - Notes

Ideas:
- Top-down 2D actiony Zelda-type game again?
- insanity? meter that gradually goes up, and bad stuff happens, once it becomes full?
	- like losing hitpoints, weird screen effects, slowdown, enemy "fakes" duplicating, that don't do damage, but confuse, worsened vision etc.
- movement is "unstable" in some way? balancing over a bridge, winds pushing the character etc?
	- limited space, limiting players movement into almost just 2 directions? like a tight rope basically?
- unstable ground, which can break, and make player fall down deeper?
	- but then its like a tower/mine, which has endless (?) levels down, that get harder though
	- the challenge is to not fall down, before you managed to get the resources/power ups from the current level, which make you stronger slowly
- player does not get to decide when to attack, but it happens automatically on a random timer every X seconds, like a bomb, chemicals, fire breathing or whatever, you are cursed maybe?
- alchemy tower? Open up with a potion in the middle of the room "Drink the option!", And then you start breathing fire periodically + tower/ground starts shaking, because alchemist got mad or something idk :P
	- all the power ups are potions too, give you more health, higher movement speed, maybe more DMG, change fire shape maybe
	
	

ToDos:
- Build 3-4 simple levels
- Move to next room, when all enemies are dead
- Enable player to win, when last room is finished, maybe just add a trigger?
- UI for Health, Attackpower, Movementspeed, level you are on, upcoming ability, just simple icon for everything + number?
- Power ups / pickups:
	- Healthpack (+ no max health, so it just always adds to your healthpool?)
	- Make attacks deal more dmg
	- Increase size of projectiles, firecone, stun range of bull charge, health healed etc? seperate power ups for each ability tho
	- Movementspeed+?
- Music + sound effects!
- Stun enemies, that were hit by bullcharge
- Add different enemy types
  - Stronger/charging Melee
  - Bosses

Low Prio / way later:
- Give characters collision boxes, so they dont overlap/stack anymore?
- Polish abilities: Have a little indicator/icon for everything, which also shows where you are aiming etc.!
	- like an arrow/symbol that slowly fills up from transparent to opaque depending on timer
	- give bull charge a little fire trail to stick with fire theme?
- instead of potions just use a staff at the beginning, and some kind of random gemstones/pickups for the power ups
	- might be easier to find than nice potions, and makes more sense, why picking up a sacred staff might make the building fall, than a random potion?
- Add melee swipes, instead of enemies just running into you?
